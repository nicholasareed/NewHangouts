		<h4>Security</h4>
		<p>Security is very important to us, so we have done our best to keep all systems secure. It is also partially your responsibility to keep our systems secure. That means <mark>not using the same password from other sites</mark>and keeping a strong password. <strong> A password is like a toothbrush, choose a good one, don't let anybody use it, and get a new one every six months. We do encrypt all passwords </strong> and no-one, not even the admins can view your password. Only you can sign in as yourself. </p>
